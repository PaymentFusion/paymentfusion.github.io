We updated the Payment Fusion Terminal Application to improve application efficiency, improve logging & analytics, and add remote restart functionality.

#### Features:

This release of the Payment Fusion Terminal Application for PAX terminals includes functionality that permits admin users to initiate a terminal restart from Control Center. Enhancements to logging & application analytics have also been added while improving memory usage through better application efficiency. Other minor bug fixes and interface updates are also included in this release to improve transaction and checkout workflows for users.
