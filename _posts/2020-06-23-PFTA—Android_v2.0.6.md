We updated the Payment Fusion Terminal Application to support recurring transaction functionality on the Payment Fusion Gateway

#### Features:

This release of the Payment Fusion Terminal Application for PAX terminals will allow recurring parameters to be handled by PFTA on PAX terminals and support the creation of recurring transaction schedules that use an initial, on-terminal transaction to store the payment method.
