We updated the Payment Fusion Terminal Application to include support for processing CareCredit® transactions on PAX A920 terminals and support for receipt printing on the A80 and A920 terminal models.

#### Features:

This release of the Payment Fusion Terminal Application for PAX terminals includes functionality that allows the A920 terminal to process CareCredit cards when dipped, swiped, or keyed. For merchants with an associated CareCredit MID, the terminal will present the cardholder with financing options relevant to each transaction. An overview and more information about this feature can be viewed here: https://vimeo.com/461852752/5a1184bec8
Other minor bug fixes and interface updates for all terminal models are also included in this release to improve transaction and checkout workflows for users.
