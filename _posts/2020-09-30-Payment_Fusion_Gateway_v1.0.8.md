This release resolves some issues with healthcare object validation, and improves reporting. 

#### Features
* Healthcare transactions must include a healthcare amount.
* Added validation for Healthcare amount, which must be less than or equal to Total Amount of a transaction.
* Audited the gateway logging for potentially sensitive data.
* Added validation on `CopayAmount` and `TransitAmount` as they related to healthcare amount.
* Adds void information to the settlement response.
* Adds reversal information to the settlement response.



#### Bugs
* Properly handles transactions for Visa, where the healthcare object only contains a value for `IIAS_Verified`.
* `IIAS_Verified` now supports the `expempt` value on Staging.
* Long merchant names (25+ characters) are now tolerated in healthcare transactions.
* The Batch Net amount is now correct when performing a credit on a force-capture.
* Correctly sends Purchase Return Authorization (PRA) refunds to the processor.
* Fixes an issue where the source can be unspecified on a batch report.
