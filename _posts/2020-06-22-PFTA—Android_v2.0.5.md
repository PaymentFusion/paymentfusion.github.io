We updated the Payment Fusion Terminal Application to improve stability and performance of PAX A80 and A920 devices, added robust support for healthcare-specific parameters that will better support the use of HSA/FSA cards, and introduced new layouts and functionality for our latest terminal model, the PAX Aries 8.

#### Features:

This release of the Payment Fusion Terminal Application for PAX terminals are paired with a new SDK release to improve application and card reader responsiveness:
* Enhancements and refinement to prompt job functionality
* UI and layout changes to better support the Aries 8 form factor
* Improvements to the Aries 8 UX and the combination chip/magstripe card reader
* Modified insert/tap/dip card animations to be more accurate
* Prompt jobs can be cancelled via an API request
* Various bug-fixes and improvements
