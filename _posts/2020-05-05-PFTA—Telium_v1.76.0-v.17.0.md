We've updated the Payment Fusion Terminal Application for Telium devices to support online remote key injection (ORKI), and improve performance.

#### Features
* Remote Key Injection — Devices in the field may have their E2E and EMV PIN keys re-injected, remotely.
* The terminal application does a better job tolerating an unstable network when performing a token lookup.

&nbsp;  
###### Deployment schedule

**PFTA—Telium v1.76.0** is available now in all environments for TSYS and First Data merchants.

**PFTA—Telium v1.77.0** is available now in all environments for Chase merchants.
