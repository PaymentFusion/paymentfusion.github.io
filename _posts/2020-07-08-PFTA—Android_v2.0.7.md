We updated the Payment Fusion Terminal Application to enhance our support of card-not-present transaction functionality on the Payment Fusion Gateway

#### Features:

This release of the Payment Fusion Terminal Application for PAX terminals will allow mail order, telephone order, and card-not-present parameters to be handled by PFTA on PAX terminals. The benefits of these parameters include better authorization rates, streamlined manual entry workflows and interchange optimization.
